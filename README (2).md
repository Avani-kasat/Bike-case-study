# Bike Case Study || Muliple Linear Regression model building exercise
> The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for the demand of shared bikes in the American market after the Covid-19 lockdown. The client, BoomBikes, aims to understand the factors influencing bike demand, enabling them to formulate a strategic business plan post-pandemic.

## General Information
-  The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can anticipate the demand for shared bikes post-lockdown. The insights derived from this model will help BoomBikes formulate an effective business strategy to meet customer demands and optimize their operations.
- The dataset contains information on daily bike demands based on various factors.
Independent variables include weather conditions ('weathersit'), season, and year ('yr'), among others.
Some features with numeric values (e.g., 'weathersit' and 'season') need to be converted into categorical string values based on the data dictionary.
